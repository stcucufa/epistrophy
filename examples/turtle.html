        <p>This example is adapted from <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/4663/">Turtle Geometry: The
        Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics</a>, by Harold Abelson and Andrea diSessa, MIT Press, 1981 (chapter
        1, page 9). Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a> in JS is
        relatively straightforward with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML
        canvas element.</a> However, one of the main features of the turtle, either as a virtual object on a computer
        screen or as a physical object drawing on a sheet of paper, is that it moves as the program executes. The drawing
        appears as the turtle is going through its instructions (forward, left, pen up, &amp;c.) so that the step it
        follows can become more apparent than if the drawing were appearing at once.</p>
        <p>The <a href="turtle.js">turtle drawing primitives</a> are animated by wrapping them in Epistrophy effects (for
        immediate effects like <code>penup</code>/<code>pendown</code> or <code>show</code>/<code>hide</code>) and ramps
        (for <code>forward</code> or <code>right</code>). The duration of the ramp is inversely proportional to the
        velocity of the turtle, and each call to the <code>rampDidProgress</code> delegate updates the position or heading
        of the turtle by small increments. All of this is achieved by associating a turtle with its own fiber, so that
        successive instructions are added to the fiber, ensuring the correct scheduling of their execution. This also
        allows additional effects like <code>wait</code>ing, which is simply a call to the fiber <code>delay</code>
        instruction.</p>
