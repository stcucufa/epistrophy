        <h1>ABRO example</h1>
        <p class="example">
            <button type="button">A</button>
            <button type="button">B</button>
            <button type="button">R</button>
            <span class="O">O</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterel#Example_(ABRO)">classic example from the synchronous
            programming language Esterel</a>: O turns on when both A and B have been pressed, in any order; R resets
            the system. These two behaviours are implemented by the two top-level spawns. The first one is the most
            complex, as it consists of a sequence of two spawns as well (for buttons A and B) and a join, meaning that
            the first spawned fiber will progress only when both buttons have been clicked. O will turn on and stay on
            forever, thanks to the ramp with infinite duration. Clicking R on the other hand will end the second spawned
            fiber, and because the top-level join uses the First join delegate, it will end as soon as that fiber ends
            and cancel the other one. Regardless of whether it was waiting for A and/or B to be clicked or waiting forever,
            cancelling it moves to the ever block at the end which resets A, B and O to their original state.
